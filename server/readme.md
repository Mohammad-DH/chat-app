## how to setup

_ git clone

_ use npm or yarn to install dependency "npm install" or "yarn"

_ make a mongodb with Replica Set (watch stream only works in this mood)

_ set .env file and put your mongodb connect link as DB 

_ add jwt security key as key in key 

_ make sure server is connected to data base and runnig on port 8000

_ use npm start or yarn start to run the server 

_ go to /signin in browser make a new user (there is no chat to show in the beginning this will fixed in new update)

_ you will redirect to log in to /login , use your account to log in

_ for testing you need another user so use a different browser and make another user 

_ now login and on left blow your username click on add button (plus image) and add other user by typing there email adress then hit add

_ you can find your contact left side of window click on them and then chat is active 

_ chat !


## admin panel 

_ go to /admin and insert name and password (if your the first person what ever you put in is gone be the admin)

_ log in to admin panel

_ you will see all the users on left side and by clicking on them you will see there data on right side

_ you can delet them completely form data base 

* if you have no user you cant log in to admin panel
* admin panel have no jwt support (see the full side of the glass, its safer!) 
* you can not have more than one admin 

there is a huge space for improvement but this is the version 0.01 made in 1 week so just dont compared to world real chat apps 
have good day
